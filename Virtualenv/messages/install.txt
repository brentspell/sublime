Hello! Thank you for testing this package.

IMPORTANT:

Before you start using the commands verify that the default settings are suitable for
your system. Check them in Preferences -> Package Settings -> Virtualenv.
*But* do not modify the default settings as you will lose all the changes if the package
is updated. You should override the necessary settings in Virtualenv -> User instead.
