Virtualenv 1.1.0
================

- pypy executables should also show up now in the list of available python targets.
- Added creation of virtualenvs with the built-in 'venv' module (Python 3.3+).
- Integration with SublimeREPL. If SublimeREPL is installed and a virtualenv is active the
  command "Virtualenv: SublimeREPL - Python" will launch a REPL with the current virtualenv.
